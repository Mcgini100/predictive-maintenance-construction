# Project Brief: Predictive Maintenance for Construction Equipment

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on developing a data-driven machine learning predictive maintenance model specifically designed for construction equipment. The aim is to transition from reactive/scheduled maintenance to a proactive, predictive approach.

## 2. Problem Statement & Challenges

Construction operations face significant challenges related to equipment maintenance:

*   **Unplanned Equipment Breakdowns:** Lead to project delays, increased operational costs, and potential safety hazards.
*   **High Maintenance Costs:** Resulting from unexpected repairs, emergency call-outs, and potentially unnecessary scheduled maintenance.
*   **Suboptimal Maintenance Scheduling:** Difficulty in planning maintenance effectively without accurate insights into equipment health, leading to either premature or delayed interventions.
*   **Reduced Equipment Lifespan:** Repeated failures and suboptimal usage can shorten the operational life of expensive machinery.

## 3. Project Goal

To enhance the reliability and efficiency of construction machinery by developing and implementing a system capable of predicting potential failures before they occur.

## 4. Objectives

The specific objectives of this project are:

*   **Early Failure Detection:** Implement ML models to identify early warning signs of potential equipment failures based on sensor data and operational parameters.
*   **Optimized Maintenance Scheduling:** Provide predictive insights to enable maintenance teams to schedule interventions proactively, just before a failure is likely to occur.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Minimize costs associated with unplanned downtime, emergency repairs, and potentially excessive preventative maintenance.
*   **Downtime Minimization:** Reduce the overall time equipment is out of service, thereby improving availability and project timelines.
*   **Improved Project Quality & Timeliness:** Contribute indirectly to better project outcomes by ensuring equipment reliability.

## 5. Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Analysis of historical maintenance logs, operational data, and sensor data (initially from provided CSV `predictive_maintainance.csv`).
    *   Data preprocessing, feature engineering tailored to construction equipment signals.
    *   Development and validation of machine learning models (e.g., classification for failure prediction, potentially regression for Remaining Useful Life estimation if data permits).
    *   Design of a conceptual system architecture for data ingestion, processing, model serving, and alerting.
    *   Development of a basic proof-of-concept dashboard for visualizing equipment health and alerts (using tools like Streamlit/Flask).
    *   Documentation covering the methodology, implementation, and findings.
*   **Out of Scope (for initial university project phase):**
    *   Real-time integration with live IoT sensors on physical equipment.
    *   Deployment onto cloud infrastructure for enterprise-scale operation.
    *   Integration with existing commercial Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS).
    *   Development of mobile applications for field technicians.
    *   Hardware setup or sensor installation.

## 6. Success Metrics (Initial)

*   Model Performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score for failure prediction.
*   Ability to identify known failure patterns in historical data.
*   Feasibility demonstration of the end-to-end pipeline (Data -> Preprocessing -> Model -> Prediction -> Basic Alert/Visualization).
