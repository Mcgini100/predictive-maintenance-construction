# Project Plan: Predictive Maintenance for Construction Equipment

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the high-level plan for the development of the predictive maintenance model. It follows the phases defined in the technical implementation plan.

## 2. Project Phases & Milestones

*(Based on the 9-step technical plan)*

*   **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Planning**
    *   Define objectives, scope, and challenges.
    *   Conduct initial (simulated) stakeholder engagement.
    *   Develop detailed project plan (this document) and initial timeline.
    *   **Milestone:** Project Kick-off & Requirements Documented.

*   **Phase 2: Data Collection and Integration**
    *   Identify data sources (primary: `predictive_maintainance.csv`).
    *   Define data format and expected fields.
    *   Establish procedures for accessing/loading the CSV data.
    *   Implement initial data quality checks (e.g., checking columns, basic stats).
    *   **Milestone:** Data Acquired and Initial Quality Assessed.

*   **Phase 3: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
    *   Perform data cleaning (missing values, outliers).
    *   Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using notebooks.
    *   Develop and select relevant features.
    *   Document preprocessing steps and rationale.
    *   Generate processed dataset for modeling.
    *   **Milestone:** Processed Data Ready & EDA Completed.

*   **Phase 4: Model Development**
    *   Research and select appropriate ML algorithms.
    *   Split data into training and testing sets.
    *   Train initial models.
    *   Perform hyperparameter tuning.
    *   Validate model performance using suitable metrics.
    *   Iteratively refine models based on results.
    *   **Milestone:** Trained and Validated Predictive Model(s) Available.

*   **Phase 5: System Architecture Design & Implementation (Conceptual/Proof-of-Concept)**
    *   Design a conceptual architecture (diagram).
    *   Implement core components in `src/` (data loading, preprocessing, training, prediction functions/scripts).
    *   Define basic data storage approach (using file system for processed data/models initially).
    *   Structure code into pipelines (`src/pipelines/`).
    *   **Milestone:** Core Code Implementation Complete & Conceptual Architecture Defined.

*   **Phase 6: User Interface Development (Basic)**
    *   Develop a simple dashboard (e.g., using Streamlit/Flask) to:
        *   Load the trained model.
        *   Allow input of simulated new data (or selection from test set).
        *   Display prediction results (e.g., failure probability, alert).
        *   Show basic visualizations (if feasible).
    *   Implement a simple alert mechanism within the dashboard.
    *   **Milestone:** Proof-of-Concept Dashboard Developed.

*   **Phase 7: Implementation & Pilot Testing (Simulated)**
    *   Test the end-to-end pipeline using hold-out test data.
    *   Simulate deployment by running the prediction pipeline on test data.
    *   Evaluate dashboard usability with simulated scenarios.
    *   Gather feedback (e.g., from supervisor, peers) on the system's functionality.
    *   Conduct unit and basic integration tests (`tests/`).
    *   **Milestone:** End-to-End System Tested (Simulated) & Basic Test Suite Implemented.

*   **Phase 8: Training, Documentation & Full Deployment (Focus on Documentation for University Project)**
    *   Prepare comprehensive project documentation:
        *   System architecture description.
        *   Data dictionary and processing steps.
        *   Model details and evaluation report.
        *   User guide for the PoC dashboard.
        *   Code documentation (docstrings).
    *   Prepare final project report/presentation.
    *   *(Full deployment across fleets is out of scope for the university phase)*.
    *   **Milestone:** Full Project Documentation and Final Report Completed.

*   **Phase 9: Monitoring & Continuous Improvement (Conceptual)**
    *   Outline strategies for future monitoring (e.g., tracking model drift).
    *   Discuss potential future enhancements and model retraining strategies.
    *   Incorporate feedback into final documentation/recommendations.
    *   **Milestone:** Future Recommendations Documented.
