# Stakeholder Engagement Notes (Planning & Template)

## 1. Purpose

To gather requirements, understand operational context, define expectations, and ensure alignment for the Predictive Maintenance project. As this is a university project, initial "stakeholders" might be simulated or represented by the project supervisor and potential industry contacts (if available).

## 2. Identified Stakeholders (Simulated/Typical)

*   **Maintenance Personnel / Technicians:**
    *   Focus: Practical usability, clarity of alerts, actionable insights, data they currently use/trust.
*   **Fleet Managers / Operations Supervisors:**
    *   Focus: Cost savings, downtime reduction, scheduling efficiency, reporting, overall fleet health view.
*   **Data Scientists / Project Team:**
    *   Focus: Data availability and quality, model performance metrics, technical feasibility, integration points.
*   **Project Supervisor / Academic Advisor:**
    *   Focus: Research methodology, novelty, scope feasibility, adherence to academic requirements, final deliverables.

## 3. Planned Activities

*   **Initial Requirements Workshop:** Discuss project goals, scope, known challenges, and available data. (Date: [Placeholder: e.g., Project Start Date])
*   **Follow-up Interviews (Simulated):** Dive deeper into specific needs of different roles.
*   **Regular Check-ins:** Maintain alignment and gather feedback throughout the project lifecycle. (Frequency: [Placeholder: e.g., Weekly/Bi-weekly])

## 4. Template for Interview/Workshop Notes

**Meeting:** [e.g., Initial Workshop with Fleet Manager (Simulated)]
**Date:** [Date]
**Attendees:** [Names/Roles]

**Key Discussion Points / Questions Asked:**

*   What are the most common types of equipment failures you experience?
*   Which equipment types are most critical / cause the most disruption when down?
*   How is maintenance currently scheduled (reactive, time-based, condition-based)?
*   What data do you currently collect or wish you could collect?
*   What does a useful "alert" look like to you? (e.g., How much advance warning? What information is needed?)
*   How do you measure the cost of downtime or a specific failure?
*   What information would be most valuable on a health monitoring dashboard?
*   What are the biggest frustrations with the current maintenance process?
*   What are the expectations for this predictive maintenance project?

**Key Takeaways / Requirements Gathered:**

*   [Requirement 1]
*   [Requirement 2]
*   [Constraint/Challenge 1]
*   [Data Point/Source Mentioned]

**Action Items:**

*   [Action Item Owner]: [Action Item Description] - [Due Date]
